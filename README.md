## Initial project description

My app will allow users to draw on screen using a mouse or touch screen and save their creations. The basic functions of the app will be:

* Tool selection: users will be able to select a drawing tool such as pencil, eraser, etc. Each tool will have different properties such as thickness, color or style.
* Color selection: users will be able to select a color for drawing. Colors will either be available in the palette or can be selected using code from the HTML color palette.

* Saving their drawings: users will be able to save their drawings as an image on their computer.

* Change the background: Users will be able to change the background color or image.

* Undo/Redo: Users will be able to undo the last step of the drawing or go back to the previous step.

* Delete Table: Users will be able to erase the entire drawing and start over.
